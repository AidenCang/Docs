## tox

What is tox?

tox is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool you can use for:

checking your package installs correctly with different Python versions and interpreters

running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your test tool of choice

acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers, greatly reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.
